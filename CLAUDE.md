# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

QA Solar is a monorepo for studying and practicing test automation with multiple frameworks. It includes full-stack applications (frontend, backend, dashboard) and comprehensive test suites using Cypress, Playwright, Robot Framework, and Selenium.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Monorepo Management:** Yarn Workspaces + Turborepo
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Dashboard:** Vue 3 + Pinia + Chart.js
- **Backend:** NestJS + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Testing:** Cypress, Playwright, Robot Framework, Selenium
- **Documentation:** Docusaurus (https://leohspaixao.github.io/qa-solar/)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Architecture

### Backend Architecture (NestJS)

The backend follows a modular NestJS architecture:

- **Modules:** Located in `apps/backend/src/modules/`
  - `auth/` - JWT authentication with passport-jwt
  - `users/` - User CRUD operations
  - `password-recovery/` - Password reset functionality
  - `prisma/` - Prisma client service (singleton pattern)

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
  - Schema: `apps/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`
  - Migrations: `apps/backend/prisma/migrations/`
  - Seeders: `apps/backend/prisma/seeders/`

- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI available at `/api` endpoint when running

### Frontend Architecture (Vue 3)

Both frontend and dashboard use Vue 3 with Composition API:

- **Module-based structure:** Each feature is a module in `src/modules/`
  - Example: `modules/auth/`, `modules/user/`
  - Each module contains: `components/`, `views/`, services, types

- **Frontend (`apps/frontend`):**
  - Form validation: VeeValidate + Yup
  - HTTP client: Axios with interceptors
  - State management: Vue Query (@tanstack/vue-query)
  - Routing: Vue Router

- **Dashboard (`apps/dashboard`):**
  - State management: Pinia
  - Charts: Chart.js with vue-chartjs
  - Feature-based organization: `src/features/`

### Testing Strategy

1. **Cypress** - E2E and component tests with code coverage
   - Uses `@cypress/code-coverage` plugin
   - Component tests use `@bahmutov/cypress-esbuild-preprocessor`
   - Reports: Mochawesome (HTML reports)
   - Tests in `tests/cypress/tests/specs/`

2. **Playwright** - E2E tests with UI mode
   - Browser automation for frontend testing
   - Tests in `tests/playwright/tests/`

3. **Robot Framework** - Keyword-driven E2E tests
   - Python-based with SeleniumLibrary
   - Uses Makefile for parallel execution
   - Tests in `tests/robot/tests/specs/`

4. **Vitest** - Unit tests for Vue components (frontend only)
   - Configured with `@vue/test-utils`
   - Coverage with c8/v8

### Preprocessor Package

The `packages/preprocessor` converts test results from various formats (XML, JSON) into a unified format:
- Reads results from Cypress, Playwright, Robot, etc.
- Uses Zod for validation
- Outputs standardized JSON

## Git Workflow

### Commit Convention

Uses **Commitlint** with conventional commits. Required format:

```
<type>: <description>

# Valid types:
- feat     # New feature
- test     # Adding/updating tests
- chore    # Maintenance tasks
- ci       # CI/CD changes
- docs     # Documentation
- story    # User story implementation
- epic     # Epic implementation
```

**Rules:**
- Scope is optional but must start with lowercase if provided
- Subject cannot be empty
- No parentheses in subject (old pattern)

### Hooks

- **Pre-commit:** Runs `yarn lint` on staged files via lint-staged
- **Commit-msg:** Validates commit message format with commitlint

## Development Workflow

1. **Starting Development:**
   ```bash
   yarn install          # Root level
   yarn dev              # Starts all apps in parallel
   ```

2. **Working on Backend:**
   - Prisma changes require `npx prisma generate` after schema updates
   - Run `npx prisma studio` to view/edit database via UI
   - Seed data: `yarn prisma:seed`

3. **Working on Frontend/Dashboard:**
   - Environment variables in `.env` files (gitignored)
   - API URLs configured via dotenv
   - Use `yarn type-check` before committing

4. **Writing Tests:**
   - Cypress: Add to `tests/cypress/tests/specs/`
   - Playwright: Add to `tests/playwright/tests/`
   - Robot: Add to `tests/robot/tests/specs/`
   - Component tests (Cypress): Co-locate with components or in specs

5. **Running Tests:**
   - Use framework-specific commands (see Common Commands)
   - For parallel execution: Use Turbo's `yarn test` at root
   - Coverage reports generated in respective `coverage/` directories

## Important Notes

- **Node Version:** Requires Node.js >=22.19.0 <23 (see `engines` in package.json)
- **Package Manager:** Yarn 1.22.22 (Classic) enforced by `packageManager` field
- **Port Conflicts:** Frontend and Dashboard both default to 127.0.0.1, but Vite auto-assigns ports
- **Docker:** Full stack can be run via `yarn docker:build` (see docker-compose.yml)
- **Test Results:** Raw results stored in `qa-results/raw/` (likely gitignored)
- **Documentation:** Built with Docusaurus, deployed to GitHub Pages

## Turborepo Task Dependencies

- `build` depends on `^build` (build dependencies first)
- `start` depends on `^build` (build before starting)
- `dev`, `test` have no dependency caching (always fresh)
- `lint` is cached with `^lint` dependency
